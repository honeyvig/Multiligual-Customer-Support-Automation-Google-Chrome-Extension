        Translate suggested responses using ChatGPT and display the result.

    Local Storage/Database:
        Store static FAQs and dynamically generated responses in local storage or Google Sheets.
        Allow employees to manually approve, reject, or edit responses.

Steps to Build the Chrome Extension:
1. Manifest File (manifest.json)

This will define the extension and its permissions.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Reamaze Assistant - ChatGPT for Customer Support",
  "description": "Automates and translates customer responses in Slovenian for Reamaze integration.",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "https://api.openai.com/*",
    "https://api.reamaze.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.reamaze.com/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://api.openai.com/*",
    "https://api.reamaze.com/*"
  ]
}

2. Background Script (background.js)

This script handles the logic behind API calls, language detection, and interaction with Reamaze and ChatGPT.

// background.js

// Function to call ChatGPT for translation and response suggestion
async function getChatGPTResponse(prompt, language = 'sl') {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';  // ChatGPT API key
  const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "text-davinci-003",  // You can use other GPT models
      prompt: prompt,
      max_tokens: 150
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.choices[0].text.trim();
}

// Function to detect language of incoming message
function detectLanguage(message) {
  const languageApiUrl = `https://api.detectlanguage.com/v1/detect?key=YOUR_DETECTLANGUAGE_API_KEY&q=${message}`;
  return fetch(languageApiUrl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => data.data.language);
}

// Send response and translate using ChatGPT
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.action === "getResponse") {
    // Get response from ChatGPT
    getChatGPTResponse(request.prompt, request.language)
      .then(response => {
        sendResponse({ reply: response });
      });
  }
  return true;  // Ensures async response
});

3. Content Script (content.js)

This script is injected into the Reamaze customer support page and reads incoming messages.

// content.js

// Function to extract messages from Reamaze (could use Reamaze API if available)
function extractReamazeMessage() {
  const messageElement = document.querySelector('.message-element-class'); // Update with actual class
  return messageElement ? messageElement.innerText : null;
}

// Function to suggest a response in Slovenian and translate using ChatGPT
function suggestResponse(message) {
  // Assuming you have predefined static FAQs or dynamic knowledge from the DB
  let prompt = "Suggest a reply in Slovenian for the following message: " + message;

  // Send message to background.js for ChatGPT response and translation
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
    { action: "getResponse", prompt: prompt, language: 'sl' },
    function(response) {
      // Display the response in a tooltip or UI
      displaySuggestedResponse(response.reply);
    }
  );
}

// Display suggested response in the extension UI
function displaySuggestedResponse(response) {
  const tooltip = document.createElement("div");
  tooltip.innerText = response;
  tooltip.style.position = 'absolute';
  tooltip.style.top = '20px';
  tooltip.style.right = '20px';
  tooltip.style.backgroundColor = '#FFF';
  tooltip.style.padding = '10px';
  tooltip.style.border = '1px solid #ccc';
  document.body.appendChild(tooltip);
}

// Observe changes in the Reamaze messages and trigger response suggestion
const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
  const message = extractReamazeMessage();
  if (message) {
    suggestResponse(message);
  }
});

observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });

4. Popup Interface (popup.html)

This provides a UI for agents to interact with the extension and view the suggested responses.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Reamaze Assistant</title>
    <style>
      body { width: 300px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding: 10px; }
      button { padding: 8px 12px; cursor: pointer; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Reamaze Assistant</h2>
    <div id="suggested-response"></div>
    <button id="send-response-btn">Send Response</button>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

5. Popup Logic (popup.js)

Handles interactions from the popup, allowing agents to approve or reject suggested responses.

// popup.js

document.getElementById('send-response-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
  const responseText = document.getElementById('suggested-response').innerText;

  if (responseText) {
    // Send the approved response to Reamaze (via API or DOM injection)
    sendResponseToReamaze(responseText);
  }
});

function sendResponseToReamaze(responseText) {
  // Assuming Reamaze API or UI interaction for sending the response
  console.log("Sending Response to Reamaze: " + responseText);
}

6. Handling Storage and Dynamic Knowledge Base

For storing FAQs and dynamic responses, you can use Chrome’s local storage API or Google Sheets via API.

// Example to store dynamic responses
function saveResponseToDatabase(question, response) {
  chrome.storage.local.set({ [question]: response });
}

Final Steps:

    Testing: Load your extension in Chrome (chrome://extensions/) and test by interacting with Reamaze.
    Deployment: Once tested, you can package the extension and publish it to the Chrome Web Store.
    API Keys: Ensure secure storage of API keys (for OpenAI and language detection).
    Documentation: Provide clear instructions for installation and usage to your support team.

Conclusion:

This Chrome extension leverages AI to automate responses, integrate multilingual capabilities, and streamline customer support in Reamaze. The system is built to be dynamic and flexible, adapting as new data and responses are gathered from your support team.
